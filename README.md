## Resources

- Dataset: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243 

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis to is to explore NYPD Complaint data provided from NYC Open Data. Specifically, the analysis will examine crime descriptions, times, and locations to create a model that will predict where and when a particular type of crime may occur. Furthermore, this will be supplemented by a tableau heat map to show areas with high crime rate. Time permitting and given the expanse of the data available, we can see if crime rates change over months/years.
