## Objective

The main objective of this analysis to is to explore NYPD Complaint data provided from NYC Open Data. This analysis is insired by increased focused on policing in the United States over the past year. We hope to make unbiased observations on crime trends using the developed model.

NYC Open Data is an open source for all types of data related to New York City. The data set we will be working with is a collection of all felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD).

Specifically, the analysis will examine crime descriptions, times, and locations to create a model that will predict when and where a particular type of crime may occur. Furthermore, this will be supplemented by a tableau heat map to show areas with high crime rate. Time permitting and given the expanse of the data available, we can see if crime rates change over months/years.
